MAN - ARCADE

Project Arcade is a software that allows you to play arcade games using different graphic libraries.
The software allows you to change "dynamically" the game and the graphic library while playing.

How to use the program :
    $> ./arcade ./lib/lib_arcade_***.so (replace *** by the name of the graphic library you want)

How to add a game :
    put a shared library of your game in the folder "games" (at the root of the project)
    the name of this shared library must be "lib_arcade_'name_of_the_game'.so"

How to add a graphic library :
    put a shared library of your graphic library in the folder "lib" (at the root of the project)
    the name of this shared library must be "lib_arcade_'name_of_the_graphic_lib'.so"
